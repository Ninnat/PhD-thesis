	abstract = {Let G(A, B) denote the two-qubit gate that acts as the one-qubit SU(2) gates A and B in the even and odd parity subspaces, respectively, of two qubits. Using a Clifford algebra formalism, we show that arbitrary uniform families of circuits of these gates, restricted to act only on nearest neighbour (n.n.) qubit lines, can be classically efficiently simulated. This reproduces a result originally proved by Valiant using his matchgate formalism, and subsequently related by others to free fermionic physics. We further show that if the n.n. condition is slightly relaxed, to allow the same gates to act only on n.n. and next n.n. qubit lines, then the resulting circuits can efficiently perform universal quantum computation. From this point of view, the gap between efficient classical and quantum computational power is bridged by a very modest use of a seemingly innocuous resource (qubit swapping). We also extend the simulation result above in various ways. In particular, by exploiting properties of Clifford operations in conjunction with the Jordan–Wigner representation of a Clifford algebra, we show how one may generalize the simulation result above to provide further classes of classically efficiently simulatable quantum circuits, which we call Gaussian quantum circuits.},

	abstract = {A model of quantum computation based on unitary matrix operations was introduced by Feynman and Deutsch. It has been asked whether the power of this model exceeds that of classical Turing machines. We show here that a significant class of these quantum computations can be simulated classically in polynomial time. In particular we show that two-bit operations characterized by 4 × 4 matrices in which the sixteen entries obey a set of five polynomial relations can be composed according to certain rules to yield a class of circuits that can be simulated classically in polynomial time. This contrasts with the known universality of two-bit operations and demonstrates that efficient quantum computation of restricted classes is reconcilable with the Polynomial Time Turing Hypothesis. Therefore, it is possible that, The techniques introduced bring the quantum computational model within the realm of algebraic complexity theory. In a manner consistent with one view of quantum physics, the wave function is simulated deterministically, and randomization arises only in the course of making measurements. The results generalize the quantum model in that they do not require the matrices to be unitary. In a different direction these techniques also yield deterministic polynomial time algorithms for the decision and parity problems for certain classes of read-twice Boolean formulae. All our results are based on the use of gates that are defined in terms of their graph matching properties.},

	abstract = {Complexity theory is built fundamentally on the notion of efficient reduction among computational problems. Classical reductions involve gadgets that map solution fragments of one problem to solution fragments of another in one-to-one, or possibly one-to-many, fashion. In this paper we propose a new kind of reduction that allows for gadgets with many-to-many correspondences, in which the individual correspondences among the solution fragments can no longer be identified. Their objective may be viewed as that of generating interference patterns among these solution fragments so as to conserve their sum. We show that such holographic reductions provide a method of translating a combinatorial problem to finite systems of polynomial equations with integer coefficients such that the number of solutions of the combinatorial problem can be counted in polynomial time if one of the systems has a solution over the complex numbers. We derive polynomial time algorithms in this way for a number of problems for which only exponential time algorithms were known before. General questions about complexity classes can also be formulated. If the method is applied to a \#P-complete problem, then polynomial systems can be obtained, the solvability of which would imply P\${\textasciicircum}\{\{{\textbackslash}tiny\{\#P\}\}\}\$ = NC2.},

Here it is shown that the set of states achievable with fermionic linear optics and particle measurements is the closure of a low dimensional Lie group. The weakness of fermionic linear optics and measurements can therefore be explained and contrasted with the strength of bosonic linear optics with particle measurements. An analysis of fermionic linear optics is used to show that the two-qubit matchgates and the simulatable matchcircuits introduced by Valiant generate a monoid of extended fermionic linear optics operators. A useful interpretation of efficient classical simulations such as this one is as a simulation of a model of non-deterministic quantum computation.

Specifically, if a circuit consists only of nearest-neighbor matchgates, an efficient classical simulation is possible if either (i) the input is a computational-basis state and the simulation requires computing probabilities of multiqubit outcomes (including also adaptive measurements) or (ii) if the input is an arbitrary product state, but the output of the circuit consists of a single qubit. In this paper we extend these results to show that matchgates are classically simulable even in the most general combination of these settings, namely, if the inputs are arbitrary product states, if the measurements are over arbitrarily many output qubits, and if adaptive measurements are allowed. This remains true even for arbitrary single-qubit measurements, albeit only in a weaker notion of classical simulation. These results make for an interesting contrast with other restricted models of computation, such as Clifford circuits or (bosonic) linear optics, where the complexity of simulation varies greatly under similar modifications.},

Recent solid-state approaches have used quantum dots, donor-atom nuclear spins or electron spins; in these architectures, the basic two-qubit quantum gate is generated by a tunable exchange interaction between spins (a Heisenberg interaction), whereas the one-qubit gates require control over a local magnetic field. Compared to the Heisenberg operation, the one-qubit operations are significantly slower, requiring substantially greater materials and device complexity—potentially contributing to a detrimental increase in the decoherence rate. Here we introduced an explicit scheme in which the Heisenberg interaction alone suffices to implement exactly any quantum computer circuit. This capability comes at a price of a factor of three in additional qubits, and about a factor of ten in additional two-qubit operations. Even at this cost, the ability to eliminate the complexity of one-qubit operations should accelerate progress towards solid-state implementations of quantum computation.},

Since the braid group representation describing the statistics of these anyons is not computationally universal, one cannot directly apply the standard TQC technique. We propose to use very noisy nontopological operations such as direct short-range interactions between anyons to simulate a universal set of gates. Assuming that all TQC operations are implemented perfectly, we prove that the threshold error rate for nontopological operations is above 14\%. The total number of nontopological computational elements that one needs to simulate a quantum circuit with L gates scales as L(lnL)3.},

It has been shown by Bravyi (2006 Phys. Rev. A 73 042313) that under the assumption of perfect braiding operations, universal quantum computation is possible if the noise rate on a particular four-fermion ancilla is below 40\%. We show that beyond a noise rate of 89\% on this ancilla the quantum computation can be efficiently simulated classically: we explicitly show that the noisy ancilla is a convex mixture of Gaussian fermionic states in this region, while for noise rates below 53\% we prove that the state is not a mixture of Gaussian states. These results are obtained by generalizing concepts in entanglement theory to the setting of Gaussian states and their convex mixtures. In particular, we develop a complete set of criteria, namely the existence of a Gaussian-symmetric extension, which determine whether a state is a convex mixture of Gaussian states.},

This formalism allows to develop the Lagrangian representation for fermionic linear optics (FLO). It covers both unitary operations and the single-mode projectors associated with FLO measurements. Using the Lagrangian representation we reduce a classical simulation of FLO to a computation of Gaussian integrals over Grassmann variables.

Thus we pose the question of whether a fermionic beam can be described, even approximately, by a complex-parametrized coherent state and define, in a natural way, approximate complex-parametrized fermion coherent states. Then we identify four appealing properties of boson coherent states (eigenstate of annihilation operator, displaced vacuum state, preservation of product states under linear coupling, and factorization of correlators) and show that these approximate complex fermion coherent states fail all four criteria. The inapplicability of complex parametrization supports the use of Grassman algebras as an appropriate alternative.},

Following the basic work of Berezin (1966 The Method of Second Quantization (New York: Academic); 1987 Introduction to Superanalysis (Dordrecht: Reidel Publishing Company)), we show that we can compute with Grassmann numbers as we do with complex numbers: derivation, integration, Fourier transform. After that we show that we have quantization formulas for fermionic observables. In particular, there exists a Moyal product formula. As an application, we consider explicit computations for propagators with quadratic Hamiltonians in annihilation and creation operators. We prove a Mehler formula for the propagator and Mehlig–Wilkinson-type formulas for the covariant and contravariant symbols of ‘metaplectic’ transformations for fermionic states.

We show that this class precisely coincides with that of the linear threshold gates. The latter is a fundamental family that appears in several fields, such as the study of neural networks. Using the above characterization, we further show that the power of matchgate circuits is surprisingly trivial in those cases where the computation is to succeed with high probability.

	abstract = {We study multi-qubit quantum channels that can be represented as a product of one-mode fermionic attenuation channels. An explicit formula for the classical capacity \$C\_1\$ and for the minimum output entropy \$S\_\{min\}\$ of these channels is proposed. We compute \$S\_\{min\}\$ analytically for any number of qubits under assumption that the minimum is achieved on a Gaussian input. Apart from that, a simple numerical method for evaluating \$S\_\{min\}\$ is developed. The method is applicable to any channels that are sufficiently noisy. For fermionic product channels the proposed formula for \$S\_\{min\}\$ agrees with the numerical results with a precision about \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-9\}\$.},

We formalize such models and show that they can be simulated classically in a time polynomial in the dimension of the Lie algebra generated by the Hamiltonians and logarithmic in the dimension of the state space. This leads to a definition of Lie-algebraic “generalized mean-field Hamiltonians.” We show that they are efficiently (exactly) solvable. Our results generalize the known weakness of fermionic linear optics computation and give conditions on control needed to exploit the full power of quantum computing.},

We show that the exponential speedup of quantum algorithms is restored if single-charge measurements are added. These enable the construction of a cnot (controlled not) gate for free fermions, using only beam splitters and spin rotations. The gate is nearly deterministic if the charge detector counts the number of electrons in a mode, and fully deterministic if it only measures the parity of that number.},

We study the problem of a classical simulation of fermionic linear optics augmented with noisy auxiliary states. If the auxiliary state can be expressed as a convex combination of pure fermionic Gaussian states, the corresponding computation scheme is classically simulable. We present an analytic characterization of the set of convex-Gaussian states in the first nontrivial case, in which the Hilbert space of the ancilla is a four-mode Fock space. We use our result to solve an open problem recently posed by de Melo et al. [New J. Phys. 15, 013015 (2013)] and to study in detail the geometrical properties of the set of convex-Gaussian states.},

	abstract = {We obtain a positive probability distribution or Q -function for an arbitrary fermionic many-body system. This is different to previous Q -function proposals, which were either restricted to a subspace of the overall Hilbert space, or used Grassmann methods that do not give probabilities. The fermionic Q -function obtained here is constructed using normally ordered Gaussian operators, which include both non-interacting thermal density matrices and BCS states. We prove that the Q -function exists for any density matrix, is real and positive, and has moments that correspond to Fermi operator moments. It is defined on a finite symmetric phase-space equivalent to the space of real, antisymmetric matrices. This has the natural SO (2 M ) symmetry expected for Majorana fermion operators. We show that there is a physical interpretation of the Q -function: it is the relative probability for observing a given Gaussian density matrix. The distribution has a uniform probability across the space at infinite temperature, while for pure states it has a maximum value on the phase-space boundary. The advantage of probabilistic representations is that they can be used for computational sampling without a sign problem.},
