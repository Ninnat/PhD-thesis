	abstract = {In this review, a general algorithm for constructing coherent states of dynamical groups for a given quantum physical system is presented. The result is that, for a given dynamical group, the coherent states are isomorphic to a coset space of group geometrical space. Thus the topological and algebraic structure of the coherent states as well as the associated dynamical system can be extensively discussed. In addition, a quantum-mechanical phase-space representation is constructed via the coherent-state theory. Several useful methods for employing the coherent states to study the physical phenomena of quantum-dynamic systems, such as the path integral, variational principle, classical limit, and thermodynamic limit of quantum mechanics, are described.},

Our problems are about α the correspondence a ↔ a between physicial quantities a and quantum operators a (quantization) and β the possibility of understanding the statistical character of quantum mechanics by averaging over uniquely determined processes as in classical statistical mechanics (interpretation). α and β are closely connected. Their meaning depends on the notion of observability. We have tried to put these problems in a form which is fit for discussion. We could not bring them to an issue. (We are inclined to restrict the meaning of α to the trivial correspondence a → a (for lim ħ → 0) and to deny the possibility suggested in β). Meanwhile special attention has been paid to the measuring process (coupling, entanglement; ignoration, infringement; selection, measurement). For the sake of simplicity the discussion has been confined to elementary non-relativistic quantum mechanics of scalar (spinless) systems with one linear degree of freedom without exchange. Exact mathematical rigour has not been aimed at.},

In the first, the distribution functions of the complete set of dynamical variables specifying a mechanical system (phase-space distributions), which are fundamental in any form of statistical dynamics, are expressed in terms of the wave vectors of quantum theory. This is shown to be equivalent to specifying a theory of functions of non-commuting operators, and may hence be considered as an interpretation of quantum kinematics. In the second part, the laws governing the transformation with time of these phase-space distributions are derived from the equations of motion of quantum dynamics and found to be of the required form for a dynamical stochastic process. It is shown that these phase-space transformation equations can be used as an alternative to the Schrödinger equation in the solution of quantum mechanical problems, such as the evolution with time of wave packets, collision problems and the calculation of transition probabilities in perturbed systems; an approximation method is derived for this purpose. The third part, quantum statistics, deals with the phase-space distribution of members of large assemblies, with a view to applications of quantum mechanics to kinetic theories of matter. Finally, the limitations of the theory, its uniqueness and the possibilities of experimental verification are discussed.},

The concept of generalized coherent states and the method of harmonic analysis are used to construct explicitly a family of phase-space functions which are postulated to satisfy the Stratonovich-Weyl correspondence with a generalized tracing condition. The symbol calculus for the phase-space functions is given by means of the generalized twisted product. The phase-space formalism is used to study the problem of the reconstruction of quantum states. In particular, we consider the reconstruction method based on measurements of displaced projectors, which comprises a number of recently proposed quantum-optical schemes and is also related to the standard methods of signal processing. A general group-theoretic description of this method is developed using the technique of harmonic expansions on the phase space.},

The class of linear mappings, each member of which is characterized by an entire analytic function of two complex variables, is studied in detail. Closed-form solutions for such mappings and for the inverse mappings are obtained and various properties of these mappings are studied. It is shown that the most commonly occurring rules of association between operators and c-numbers (the Weyl, the normal, the antinormal, the standard, and the antistandard rules) belong to this class and are, in fact, the simplest ones in a clearly defined sense. It is shown further that the problem of expressing an operator in an ordered form according to some prescribed rule is equivalent to an appropriate mapping of the operator on a c-number space. The theory provides a systematic technique for the solution of numerous quantum-mechanical problems that were treated in the past by ad hoc methods, and it furnishes a new approach to many others.

It is shown that there is a whole class of such representations, one associated with each type of mapping, the simplest one being the well-known representation due to Weyl. For each representation, the quantum-mechanical expectation value of an operator is found to be expressible in the form of a phase-space average of classical statistical mechanics. The phase-space distribution functions are, however, not true probabilities, in general. The phase-space forms of the main quantum-mechanical equations of motion are obtained and are found to have the form of a generalized Liouville equation. The phase-space form of the Bloch equation for the density operator of a quantum system in thermal equilibrium is also derived. The generalized characteristic functions of boson systems are defined and their main properties are studied. The equations of motion for the characteristic functions are also derived.

We introduce contextuality witnesses for rebit states and discuss the compatibility of our result with state-independent contextuality.},

Coherent spin states provide an alternative route to the same phase-space description of spin. The Wigner functions for spin states and transitions are exhibited up to j = 2. It is shown that for Hamiltonians such as arise from time-dependent magnetic fields, the quantum spin dynamics is given entirely by the classical motion on the sphere.

In analogy to this approach, a discrete Moyal formalism is defined on the basis of a modified set of postulates. It is shown that appropriately modified postulates single out a well-defined set of kernels that give rise to discrete symbols. Now operators are represented by functions taking values on (2s+1)2 points of the sphere. The discrete symbols contain no redundant information, contrary to the continuous ones. The properties of the resulting discrete Moyal formalism for a quantum spin are worked out in detail and compared to the continuous formalism.},

Here we investigate an alternative class of discrete Wigner functions, in which the field of real numbers that labels the axes of continuous phase space is replaced by a finite field having N elements. There exists such a field if and only if N is a power of a prime; so our formulation can be applied directly only to systems for which the state-space dimension takes such a value. Though this condition may seem limiting, we note that any quantum computer based on qubits meets the condition and can thus be accommodated within our scheme.

Indeed, the quantum mechanics of such systems can be formulated entirely in terms of the Wigner function and other functions on phase space, with no mention of state vectors or operators. In the present paper this Wigner-function formulation is extended to systems having only a finite number of orthogonal states. The “phase space” for such a system is taken to be not continuous but discrete. In the simplest cases it can be pictured as an N×N array of points, where N is the number of orthogonal states. The Wigner function is a real function on this phase space, defined so that its properties are closely analogous to those of the original Wigner function. In this formulation, observables, like states, are represented by real functions on the discrete phase space. The complex numbers still play an important role: they appear in an essential way in the rule for forming composite systems.},

It is comprised of ℓ-component systems which are coupled in a particular way and is described by a certain class of Hamiltonians. Displacements in the GF( p ℓ ) × GF( p ℓ ) phase space and the corresponding Heisenberg–Weyl group are studied. Symplectic transformations are shown to form the Sp(2, GF( p ℓ )) group. Wigner and Weyl functions are defined and their properties are studied.

If they commute with the Hamiltonian, there are constants of motion which are discussed.

We prove that, in the discrete scenario, this permutation symmetry is equivalent to the symmetry group being a unitary 2 design. Such a highly symmetric representation can only appear in odd prime power dimensions besides dimensions 2 and 8. It suffices to single out a unique discrete Wigner function among all possible quasiprobability representations.

Turning to mixed states, it might be surmised that only convex combinations of stabilizer states give rise to non-negative Wigner distributions. We refute this conjecture by means of a counterexample. Further, we give an axiomatic characterization which completely fixes the definition of the Wigner function and compare two approaches to stabilizer states for Hilbert spaces of prime-power dimensions.

This paper improves that theorem in several directions. First, by removing the need for Gaussian elimination, we make the simulation algorithm much faster at the cost of a factor of 2 increase in the number of bits needed to represent a state. We have implemented the improved algorithm in a freely available program called CHP (CNOT-Hadamard-phase), which can handle thousands of qubits easily. Second, we show that the problem of simulating stabilizer circuits is complete for the classical complexity class ⊕L, which means that stabilizer circuits are probably not even universal for classical computation. Third, we give efficient algorithms for computing the inner product between two stabilizer states, putting any n-qubit stabilizer circuit into a “canonical form” that requires at most O(n2/logn) gates, and other useful tasks. Fourth, we extend our simulation algorithm to circuits acting on mixed states, circuits containing a limited number of nonstabilizer gates, and circuits acting on general tensor-product initial states but containing only a limited number of measurements.},

We show that the action of the Clifford operators on stabilizer states can be fully described by a single contribution of a path integral truncated at order ℏ0 and so are “classical,” just like propagation of Gaussians under harmonic Hamiltonians in the continuous case. Such operations have no dependence on phase or quantum interference. Conversely, we show that supplementing the Clifford group with gates necessary for universal quantum computation results in a propagator consisting of a finite number of semiclassical path-integral contributions truncated at order ℏ1, a number that nevertheless scales exponentially with the number of qudits. The same sum in continuous systems has an infinite number of terms at order ℏ1.},

However, this does not preclude states that are non-negative from exhibiting phenomena typically associated with quantum mechanics—the single qubit stabilizer states have non-negative Wigner functions and yet play a fundamental role in many quantum information tasks. We seek to determine what other sets of quantum states and measurements of a qubit can be non-negative in a quasiprobability distribution, and to identify nontrivial groups of unitary transformations that permute the states in such a set. These sets of states and measurements are analogous to the single qubit stabilizer states. We show that no quasiprobability representation of a qubit can be non-negative for more than two bases in any plane of the Bloch sphere. Furthermore, there is a unique set of four bases that can be non-negative in an arbitrary quasiprobability representation of a qubit. We provide an exhaustive list of the sets of single qubit bases that are non-negative in some quasiprobability distribution and are also closed under a group of unitary transformations. This list includes two nontrivial families of three bases that both include the single qubit stabilizer states as a special case. For qudits, we prove that there can be no more than 2d2 states in non-negative bases of a d-dimensional Hilbert space in any quasiprobability representation. Furthermore, these bases must satisfy certain symmetry constraints, corresponding to requiring the bases to be sufficiently different from each other.},

Here we prove a remarkable equivalence between the onset of contextuality and the possibility of universal quantum computation via ‘magic state’ distillation, which is the leading model for experimentally realizing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. This is a conceptually satisfying link, because contextuality, which precludes a simple ‘hidden variable’ model of quantum mechanics, provides one of the fundamental characterizations of uniquely quantum phenomena. Furthermore, this connection suggests a unifying paradigm for the resources of quantum information: the non-locality of quantum theory is a particular kind of contextuality, and non-locality is already known to be a critical resource for achieving advantages with quantum communication. In addition to clarifying these fundamental issues, this work advances the resource framework for quantum computation, which has a number of practical applications, such as characterizing the efficiency and trade-offs between distinct theoretical and experimental schemes for achieving robust quantum computation, and putting bounds on the overhead cost for the classical simulation of quantum algorithms.},

Here we consider the question of whether, for such circuits, the relative phases of different discrete-time paths through the configuration space can be defined in terms of a classical action, as they are for continuous-time paths. We show how to do so for certain kinds of quantum circuits, namely, Clifford circuits where the elementary systems are continuous-variable systems or discrete systems of odd-prime dimension. These types of circuit are distinguished by having phase-space representations that serve to define their classical counterparts. For discrete systems, the phase-space coordinates are also discrete variables. We show that for each gate in the generating set, one can associate a symplectomorphism on the phase-space and to each of these one can associate a generating function, defined on two copies of the configuration space. For discrete systems, the latter association is achieved using tools from algebraic geometry. Finally, we show that if the action functional for a discrete-time path through a sequence of gates is defined using the sum of the corresponding generating functions, then it yields the correct relative phases for the path-sum expression. These results are likely to be relevant for quantizing physical theories where time is fundamentally discrete, characterizing the classical limit of discrete-time quantum dynamics, and proving complexity results for quantum circuits.},

The aim of the model, developed for continuous and discrete prime degrees of freedom, is to advocate the epistemic view of quantum theory, where quantum states are states of incomplete knowledge about a deeper underlying reality. Many aspects of quantum mechanics and protocols from quantum information can be reproduced in the model. In spite of its significance, a number of aspects of Spekkens’ model remained incomplete. Formal rules for the update of states after measurement had not been written down, and the theory had only been constructed for prime-dimensional and infinite dimensional systems. In this work, we remedy this, by deriving measurement update rules and extending the framework to derive models in all dimensions, both prime and non-prime. Stabiliser quantum mechanics (SQM) is a sub-theory of quantum mechanics with restricted states, transformations and measurements. First derived for the purpose of constructing error correcting codes, it now plays a role in many areas of quantum information theory. Previously, it had been shown that Spekkens’ model was operationally equivalent to SQM in the case of odd prime dimensions. Here, exploiting known results on Wigner functions, we extend this to show that Spekkens’ model is equivalent to SQM in all odd dimensions, prime and non-prime. This equivalence provides new technical tools for the study of technically difficult compound-dimensional SQM.},

We prove that an alternate approach to defining a set of quasi-probability representations, based on a more natural generalization of a classical representation, is equivalent to our earlier approach based on frames, and therefore is also subject to our no-go theorem for a non-negative representation. Furthermore, we clarify the relationship between the contextuality of quantum theory and the necessity of negativity in quasi-probability representations and discuss their relevance as criteria for non-classicality. We also provide a comprehensive overview of known quasi-probability representations and their expression within the frame formalism.},

Although both of these notions were meant to characterize the conditions under which a classical explanation cannot be provided, we demonstrate that they prove inadequate to the task and we argue for a particular way of generalizing and revising them. With the refined version of each in hand, it becomes apparent that they are in fact one and the same.

This feature is of no special consequence in the continuous phase plane. But in the finite phase plane, it is of crucial importance. This doubling feature enables one to define the finite phase plane Wigner function directly from the Wigner function in the continuous phase plane. Bearing in mind the doubling feature of the Wigner function, we define the inversion operator not only around the points of the discrete phase plane lattice but also around their mid-points.

In particular, the qubit phase space provides the simplest example of a four-point non-commutative phase space. We give an explicit expression of the Moyal bracket as a differential operator. We then compare the quantum dynamics encoded by the Moyal bracket to the classical dynamics: we show that the classical Poisson bracket does not satisfy the Jacobi identity thus leaving the Moyal bracket as the only consistent symplectic structure.

The inevitable appearance of negativity in such representations is often regarded as a signature of nonclassicality, which has profound implications for quantum computation. However, little is known about the minimal negativity that is necessary in general quasiprobability representations. Here we focus on a natural class of quasiprobability representations that is distinguished by simplicity and economy. We introduce three measures of negativity concerning the representations of quantum states, unitary transformations, and quantum channels, respectively. Quite surprisingly, all three measures lead to the same representations with minimal negativity, which are in one-to-one correspondence with the elusive symmetric informationally complete measurements. In addition, most representations with minimal negativity are automatically covariant with respect to the Heisenberg-Weyl groups. Furthermore, our study reveals an interesting tradeoff between negativity and symmetry in quasiprobability representations.},

	abstract = {The problem of expanding a density operator ρ in forms that simplify the evaluation of important classes of quantum-mechanical expectation values is studied. The weight function P(α) of the P representation, the Wigner distribution W(α), and the function ⟨α{\textbar}ρ{\textbar}α⟩, where {\textbar}α⟩ is a coherent state, are discussed from a unified point of view. Each of these quasiprobability distributions is examined as the expectation value of a Hermitian operator, as the weight function of an integral representation for the density operator and as the function associated with the density operator by one of the operator-function correspondences defined in the preceding paper. The weight function P(α) of the P representation is shown to be the expectation value of a Hermitian operator all of whose eigenvalues are infinite. The existence of the function P(α) as an infinitely differentiable function is found to be equivalent to the existence of a well-defined antinormally ordered series expansion for the density operator in powers of the annihilation and creation operators a and a†. The Wigner distribution W(α) is shown to be a continuous, uniformly bounded, square-integrable weight function for an integral expansion of the density operator and to be the function associated with the symmetrically ordered power-series expansion of the density operator. The function ⟨α{\textbar}ρ{\textbar}α⟩, which is infinitely differentiable, corresponds to the normally ordered form of the density operator. Its use as a weight function in an integral expansion of the density operator is shown to involve singularities that are closely related to those which occur in the P representation. A parametrized integral expansion of the density operator is introduced in which the weight function W(α,s) may be identified with the weight function P(α) of the P representation, with the Wigner distribution W(α), and with the function ⟨α{\textbar}ρ{\textbar}α⟩ when the order parameter s assumes the values s=+1, 0, −1, respectively. The function W(α,s) is shown to be the expectation value of the ordered operator analog of the δ function defined in the preceding paper. This operator is in the trace class for Res{\textless}0, has bounded eigenvalues for Res=0, and has infinite eigenvalues for s=1. Marked changes in the properties of the quasiprobability distribution W(α,s) are exhibited as the order parameter s is varied continuously from s=−1, corresponding to the function ⟨α{\textbar}ρ{\textbar}α⟩, to s=+1, corresponding to the function P(α). Methods for constructing these functions and for using them to compute expectation values are presented and illustrated with several examples. One of these examples leads to a physical characterization of the density operators for which the P representation is appropriate.},

	abstract = {Methods are developed for discussing the photon statistics of arbitrary fields in fully quantum-mechanical terms. In order to keep the classical limit of quantum electrodynamics plainly in view, extensive use is made of the coherent states of the field. These states, which reduce the field correlation functions to factorized forms, are shown to offer a convenient basis for the description of fields of all types. Although they are not orthogonal to one another, the coherent states form a complete set. It is shown that any quantum state of the field may be expanded in terms of them in a unique way. Expansions are also developed for arbitrary operators in terms of products of the coherent state vectors. These expansions are discussed as a general method of representing the density operator for the field. A particular form is exhibited for the density operator which makes it possible to carry out many quantum-mechanical calculations by methods resembling those of classical theory. This representation permits clear insights into the essential distinction between the quantum and classical descriptions of the field. It leads, in addition, to a simple formulation of a superposition law for photon fields. Detailed discussions are given of the incoherent fields which are generated by superposing the outputs of many stationary sources. These fields are all shown to have intimately related properties, some of which have been known for the particular case of blackbody radiation.},

Noting the fact that Clifford and Gaussian operations preserve the positivity of the Wigner function, our result generalizes the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Our algorithm provides a way of sampling from the output distribution of a computation or a simulation, including the efficient sampling from an approximate output distribution in the case of sampling imperfections for initial states, gates, or measurements. In this sense, this work highlights the role of the positive Wigner function as separating classically efficiently simulable systems from those that are potentially universal for quantum computing and simulation, and it emphasizes the role of negativity of the Wigner function as a computational resource.},

It is shown that these characteristic functions allow a universal differentiating procedure for calculating averages of arbitrary ordered noncommuting observables and satisfy the same criterion of non-negative definiteness as the Fourier transforms of the everywhere non-negative probability distribution (the characteristic functions in classical probability theory). The group-theoretical characteristic-function formalism is especially useful in providing easy reductions of the dynamics of complicated quantum systems to the evolutions of a set of quantum variables that are of particular interest. As examples of applications, the following results are derived: (a) a hierarchy of equations of motion for subsystems of a given N-body quantum system (a quantum analog of the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy), (b) an equation of motion for centers of mass of two interacting quantum systems, and (c) the behavior of spin fluctuations of an ideal spin gas in the thermodynamic limit.},

We show that these conditions provide useful practical tools for investigating the effects of imperfections in implementations of boson sampling. In particular, we apply our formalism to boson-sampling experiments that use single-photon or spontaneous-parametric-down-conversion sources and on-off photodetectors. Considering simple models for loss and noise, we show that above some threshold for the probability of random counts in the photodetectors, these boson-sampling experiments are classically simulatable. We identify mode mismatching as the major source of error contributing to random counts and suggest that this is the chief challenge for implementations of boson sampling of interesting size.},

	abstract = {We consider a version of the extended Clifford Group which is defined in terms of a finite Galois field in odd prime power dimension. We show that Neuhauser's result, that with the appropriate choice of phases the standard (or metaplectic) representation of the discrete symplectic group is faithful also holds for the anti-unitary operators of the extended group. We also improve on Neuhauser's result by giving explicit formulae for the (anti-)unitary corresponding to an arbitrary (anti-)symplectic matrix. We then go on to find the eigenvalues and the order of an arbitrary (anti-)symplectic matrix. The fact that in prime power dimension the matrix elements belong to a field means that this can be done using the same techniques which are used to find the eigenvalues of a matrix defined over the reals-including the use of an extension field (the analogue of the complex numbers) when the eigenvalues are not in the base field. We then give an application of these results to SIC-POVMs (symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued measures). We show that in prime dimension our results can be used to find a natural basis for the eigenspace of the Zauner unitary in which SIC-fiducials are expected to lie. Finally, we apply our results to the MUB cycling problem. We show that in odd prime power dimension d, although there is no Clifford unitary, there is a Clifford anti-unitary which cycles through the full set of Wootters-Fields MUBs if d=3 (mod 4). Also, irrespective of whether d=1 or 3 (mod 4), the Wootters-Fields MUBs split into two groups of (d+1)/2 bases in such a way that there is a single Clifford unitary which cycles through each group separately.},

The diversity and quality of these analogies is taken as evidence for the view that quantum states are states of incomplete knowledge rather than states of reality.

We show that in most respects it would appear to us as quantum. The statistical theory of classical mechanics, which specifies how probability distributions over phase space evolve under Hamiltonian evolution and under measurements, is typically called Liouville mechanics, so the theory we explore here is Liouville mechanics with an epistemic restriction. The particular epistemic restriction we posit as our foundational postulate specifies two constraints. The first constraint is a classical analog of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle; the second-order moments of position and momentum defined by the phase-space distribution that characterizes an agent's knowledge are required to satisfy the same constraints as are satisfied by the moments of position and momentum observables for a quantum state. The second constraint is that the distribution should have maximal entropy for the given moments. Starting from this postulate, we derive the allowed preparations, measurements, and transformations and demonstrate that they are isomorphic to those allowed in Gaussian quantum mechanics and generate the same experimental statistics. We argue that this reconstruction of Gaussian quantum mechanics constitutes additional evidence in favor of a research program wherein quantum states are interpreted as states of incomplete knowledge and that the phenomena that do not arise in Gaussian quantum mechanics provide the best clues for how one might reconstruct the full quantum theory.},

This is termed an “epistemic restriction” because it implies a fundamental limit on the amount of knowledge that any observer can have about the physical state of a classical system. This article provides an overview of epistricted theories, that is, theories that start from a classical statistical theory and apply an epistemic restriction. We consider both continuous and discrete degrees of freedom, and show that a particular epistemic restriction called classical complementarity provides the beginning of a unification of all known epistricted theories. This restriction appeals to the symplectic structure of the underlying classical theory and consequently can be applied to an arbitrary classical degree of freedom. As such, it can be considered as a kind of quasi-quantization scheme; “quasi” because it generally only yields a theory describing a subset of the preparations, transformations and measurements allowed in the full quantum theory for that degree of freedom, and because in some cases, such as for binary variables, it yields a theory that is a distortion of such a subset. Finally, we propose to classify quantum phenomena as weakly or strongly nonclassical by whether or not they can arise in an epistricted theory.},

Distribution functions correspond to certain distinguished sets in the group algebra. The marginal properties of a particular class of distribution functions (Wigner distributions) arise from a class of automorphisms of the group algebra of the Heisenberg group.

	abstract = {A projection operator is defined in terms of coset representatives and “coset harmonics.” This operator is then used to construct fully symmetrized states describing N identical two-level atoms. The properties and quantum numbers of the symmetrized states are fully discussed. Fully symmetrized and labeled states for N identical 3 (or r) level atoms are constructed by a natural extension of this procedure. The interaction Hamiltonian, which describes transitions in an r-level atom, is constructed from the shift operators in the algebra of SU(r). When each of the N identical atoms “sees” the same field dependence, transitions are only allowed between energy eigenstates occurring within the same SU(r) unitary irreducible representation. Physical dispersion of the particles out of the coherence region of the field leads to “leakage” out of an SU(r) representation. If each two-level atom evolves from the ground state under the same field dependence, the total system state is a coherent superposition of bases belonging to the fully symmetric representation \{N = 2J\}2. These states exist in 1-1 correspondence with points in the surface of a unit sphere. They are therefore called Bloch states. The properties of Bloch states are derived and are seen to resemble the properties of coherent photon states. The connection is made manifest by a group contraction process. All properties of Glauber states can be constructed by contraction from the corresponding properties of the Bloch states. The states corresponding to N-identical r-level particles evolving under a coherent field are constructed in the same way. These states exist in 1-1 correspondence with points in the coset space SU(r)U(r−1), which is a Riemannian-symmetric space. The eigenstate expansions, inner products, eigenvalue equations, and uncertainty relations for these states are derived. More generally, systems of N identical (p + q) level atoms, evolving from the lowest q levels under a coherent field, are described by states existing in 1 - 1 correspondence with Riemannian symmetric space SU(p + q)S[U(p)×U(q)]. The properties of these spaces are used to give a geometric analytic interpretation to these coherent atomic states.},

Lett. 117, 180401 (2016)]. Such functions take the form of expectation values of an observable that has a direct analogy to displaced parity operators. In this work we give a procedure for the measurement of the Wigner function that should be applicable to any quantum system. We have applied our procedure to IBM's Quantum Experience five-qubit quantum processor to demonstrate that we can measure and generate the Wigner functions of two different Bell states as well as the five-qubit Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger state. Because Wigner functions for spin systems are not unique, we define, compare, and contrast two distinct examples. We show how the use of these Wigner functions leads to an optimal method for quantum state analysis especially in the situation where specific characteristic features are of particular interest (such as for spin Schrödinger cat states). Furthermore we show that this analysis leads to straightforward, and potentially very efficient, entanglement test and state characterization methods.},

A fundamental differentiation is whether all projections have the same rank r, and furthermore the special case r = 1, which contains two important subclasses: Mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) were introduced prior to this thesis and solutions of b + 1 MUBs whenever b is a power of a prime were already given. Unaware of those papers, this concept was generalized here under the notation of regular affine quantum designs. Maximal solutions are given for the general case r ≥ 1, consisting of r(b2 - 1)/(b - r) so-called complete orthogonal classes whenever b is a power of a prime. For b = 6, an infinite family of MUB triples was constructed and it was — as already done in the author's master's thesis (1991) — conjectured that four MUBs do not exist in this dimension. Symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (SIC POVMs) in this paper are called regular quantum 2-designs with degree 1. The assigned vectors span b2 equiangular lines. These objects had been investigated since the 1960s, but only a few solutions were known in complex vector spaces. In this thesis further maximal analytic and numerical solutions were given (today a lot more solutions are known) and it was (probably for the first time) conjectured that solutions exist in any dimension b (generated by the Weyl–Heisenberg group and with a certain additional symmetry of order 3).},

We show how each Clifford circuit can be reduced to an equivalent, manifestly simulatable circuit (normal form). This provides a simple proof of the Gottesman-Knill theorem without resorting to stabilizer techniques. The normal form highlights why Clifford circuits have such limited computational power in spite of their high entangling power. At the same time, the normal form shows how the classical simulation of Clifford circuits fits into the standard way of embedding classical computation into the quantum circuit model. This leads to simple extensions of Clifford circuits which are classically simulatable. These circuits can be efficiently simulated by classical sampling ('weak simulation') even though the problem of exactly computing the outcomes of measurements for these circuits ('strong simulation') is proved to be \#P-complete--thus showing that there is a separation between weak and strong classical simulation of quantum computation.},

	abstract = {We give new evidence that quantum computers -- moreover, rudimentary quantum computers built entirely out of linear-optical elements -- cannot be efficiently simulated by classical computers. In particular, we define a model of computation in which identical photons are generated, sent through a linear-optical network, then nonadaptively measured to count the number of photons in each mode. This model is not known or believed to be universal for quantum computation, and indeed, we discuss the prospects for realizing the model using current technology. On the other hand, we prove that the model is able to solve sampling problems and search problems that are classically intractable under plausible assumptions. Our first result says that, if there exists a polynomial-time classical algorithm that samples from the same probability distribution as a linear-optical network, then P\#P=BPPNP, and hence the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level. Unfortunately, this result assumes an extremely accurate simulation. Our main result suggests that even an approximate or noisy classical simulation would already imply a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. For this, we need two unproven conjectures: the Permanent-of-Gaussians Conjecture, which says that it is \#P-hard to approximate the permanent of a matrix A of independent N(0,1) Gaussian entries, with high probability over A; and the Permanent Anti-Concentration Conjecture, which says that {\textbar}Per(A){\textbar}{\textgreater}=√(n!)poly(n) with high probability over A. We present evidence for these conjectures, both of which seem interesting even apart from our application. This paper does not assume knowledge of quantum optics. Indeed, part of its goal is to develop the beautiful theory of noninteracting bosons underlying our model, and its connection to the permanent function, in a self-contained way accessible to theoretical computer scientists.},

In addition, we allow the creation of a one-qubit ancilla in a mixed state ρ, which should be regarded as a parameter of the model. Our goal is to determine for which ρ universal quantum computation (UQC) can be efficiently simulated. To answer this question, we construct purification protocols that consume several copies of ρ and produce a single output qubit with higher polarization. The protocols allow one to increase the polarization only along certain “magic” directions. If the polarization of ρ along a magic direction exceeds a threshold value (about 65\%), the purification asymptotically yields a pure state, which we call a magic state. We show that the Clifford group operations combined with magic states preparation are sufficient for UQC. The connection of our results with the Gottesman-Knill theorem is discussed.},

We introduce two quantitative measures—monotones—for the amount of non-stabilizer resource. As an application we give absolute bounds on the efficiency of magic state distillation. One of these monotones is the sum of the negative entries of the discrete Wigner representation of a quantum state, thereby resolving a long-standing open question of whether the degree of negativity in a quasi-probability representation is an operationally meaningful indicator of quantum behavior.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02806},
	abstract = {We show that there are two distinct aspects of a general quantum circuit that can make it hard to efficiently simulate with a classical computer. The first aspect, which has been well-studied, is that it can be hard to efficiently estimate the probability associated with a particular measurement outcome. However, we show that this aspect alone does not determine whether a quantum circuit can be efficiently simulated. The second aspect is that, in general, there can be an exponential number of `relevant' outcomes that are needed for an accurate simulation, and so efficient simulation may not be possible even in situations where the probabilities of individual outcomes can be efficiently estimated. We show that these two aspects are distinct, the former being necessary but not sufficient for simulability whilst the pair is jointly sufficient for simulability. Specifically, we prove that a family of quantum circuits is efficiently simulable if it satisfies two properties: one related to the efficiency of Born rule probability estimation, and the other related to the sparsity of the outcome distribution. We then prove a pair of hardness results (using standard complexity assumptions and a variant of a commonly-used average case hardness conjecture), where we identify families of quantum circuits that satisfy one property but not the other, and for which efficient simulation is not possible. To prove our results, we consider a notion of simulation of quantum circuits that we call epsilon-simulation. This notion is less stringent than exact sampling and is now in common use in quantum hardness proofs.},

The ‘eigenangles’ α must be multiples of 2πn(N), where n(N) is the lowest common multiple of the lengths of the classical ‘cycles’ mapped under T by those rational points in q, p which are multiples of ΔqN and ΔpN (i.e. n(N) is the ‘period of T mod N′), at least for odd N. If T is hyperbolic, n is a very erratic function of N, and the classical limit N → ∞ is very different from the ‘Bohr-Sommerfeld’ behaviour for parabolic maps. The degeneracy structure of the eigenangle spectrum is related to the distribution of cycle lengths. Computation of the quantal Wigner function shows that eigenstates of U do not correspond to individual cycles.},
